# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and prediction — and serves as a foundation for more advanced image recognition projects.
